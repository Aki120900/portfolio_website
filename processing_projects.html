                    <h3>Project 1: Generative Vector Abstraction</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The code combines image-based patterns, artistic shapes, and interactive bouncing balls to create an engaging and visually captivating display. It offers a blend of artistic expression and dynamic motion, making it an intriguing visual experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Imaginative Visual Display:</p>
                    <p>The code creates a captivating visual display using the Processing programming language.</p>
                    <p>It generates a mesmerizing pattern of colored circles based on an image.</p>
                    <p>The circles are scattered randomly across the screen, creating an abstract representation of the image.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Artistic Shapes:</p>
                    <p>Alongside the circles, the code draws artistic shapes, including a triangle, square, circle, and lines.</p>
                    <p>Each shape is ﬁlled with vibrant colors, adding visual interest to the display.</p>
                    <p>The combination of shapes and circles creates an artistic and visually appealing composition.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Bouncing Balls:</p>
                    <p>The code introduces a set of bouncing balls that move around the screen.</p>
                    <p>Each ball has a unique color and size, adding dynamic elements to the display.</p>
                    <p>The balls exhibit gravity-like behavior, gradually accelerating their downward motion.</p>
                    <p>When a ball reaches the screen's boundaries, it bounces back, creating an interactive effect.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Notes inspiration about artworks:</p>
                    <p>I have created a sketch that produces a colourful image resembling a speciﬁc 20th-century abstract artists.</p>
                    <p>As I embarked on writing the code, I decided to incorporate the styles of two artists into my work: Wassily Kandinsky's "Homage to Grohmann" and Gerhard Richter's "Abstract Painting 599" from 1986. Kandinsky's work captivates me due to its distinct shapes and their arrangements.</p>
                    <p>While coding, I carefully replicated the shapes from "Homage to Grohmann," such as triangles, circles, squares, and two lines. I meticulously applied colours to them and positioned them correctly. To introduce dynamic elements into the composition, I experimented with a moving ellipse, creating captivating variations. Furthermore, I employed my understanding of pixel structures to incorporate the colours from Richter's "Abstract Painting 599" into my sketch, utilizing ellipses and image manipulation techniques.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Notes on the design decisions:</p>
                    <p>Originally, I had planned to incorporate only Wassily Kandinsky's "Homage to Grohmann" into my code. However, I was truly inspired by the colour palette in Gerhard Richter's "Abstract Painting 599." It left such a profound impression on me that I couldn't resist merging the two artworks in my project. I envisioned using Gerhard Richter's "Abstract Painting 599" as the background, allowing the geometric shapes to boldly emerge against the vibrant canvas and creating an intriguing exotic composition. Imagine the interplay of colours and forms, producing mesmerising visual effects that transport us into the realm of abstract art.</p>
                    <p>My goal was to capture the essence and style of both artists, merging their works into a unique and awe-inspiring piece of art that will captivate and delight viewers. Additionally, I aimed to infuse the ﬁnal creation with a sense of depth and emotion, inviting observers to explore the depths of artistic expression.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Sound and Visuals Synthesizer</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Brief outline of what it does:</p>
                    <p>This project is a visual and interactive program written in Processing. It creates a scene with particles and sparkles that move around the screen. The movement and appearance of the particles and sparkles are inﬂuenced by the sound volume, which can be adjusted using increase and decrease buttons. The program uses the Minim library for audio synthesis and playback.</p>
                    <p>The audio aspect of the program is powered by the remarkable Minim library. It brings to life an oscillating waveform that complements the visuals, immersing you in an all-encompassing sensory experience. The increase and decrease buttons provide a simple yet effective means to ﬁne-tune the audio, allowing you to orchestrate a symphony of colors and sounds.</p>
                    <p>The project creates a visual display of moving particles and sparkles. The sound volume can be adjusted using buttons, which affect the animation and movement of the visual elements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Notes on the design decision № 1:</p>
                    <p>During the creation of the project, I came up with a few ideas to enhance the design. I decided to incorporate arrow buttons for sound control, resembling the arrows you ﬁnd on a computer keyboard.

                    Why are they orange, you may wonder? Well, I have a profound love for ﬁreplaces, and gazing into a blazing ﬁre is my eternal bliss. That's precisely why I opted for a campﬁre motif in the prototype of my project, and consequently, the buttons are adorned in shades of orange.
                        
                    Moreover, to captivate users' interest, I resolved to add a subtle animation to these arrow buttons. When pressed, they instantly change their hue to red, mirroring the association between ﬂames and the color red.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Notes on the design decision № 2:</p>
                    <p>The second idea to enhance the project was to visually represent ﬁre in the form of an explosive burst when the code starts running.

                    ❏ Firstly, I wanted to create a shape that resembled ﬂames. After numerous attempts and creative explorations, I settled on using circles.
                        
                    ❏ Secondly, it was crucial to determine the colors of these circles. This part was relatively straightforward as I aimed to capture the ﬁery hues, such as orange, yellow, and a touch of red.
                        
                    ❏ Fnally, as a third step, I decided to incorporate gleams to provide structure and add a captivating visual impact to the explosion.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Notes on the design decision № 3:</p>
                    <p>The next idea to enhance the design involves creating new functionality for the project, speciﬁcally related to controlling the volume using arrow buttons. I have decided to incorporate a visual explosion that changes based on whether the sound is being increased or decreased.

                    Therefore, when the up arrow button is pressed, the visual explosion of ﬂames will accelerate, accompanied by an increase in volume. Pressing the down arrow button will gradually decrease the sound, and if held for an extended period, it will be completely muted.
                        
                    Meanwhile, the visual effect will either slow down, resembling slow-motion footage, or freeze entirely, as if paused.
                        
                    For the ﬁnal touch, I have decided to reﬁne the visual representation of the explosion. I concluded that the explosion should originate from the center, with circles bursting outwards, emulating the effect of a detonation. These elements will then move randomly across the screen, as ﬁre disperses chaotically in various directions after an explosion. This will introduce an element of unpredictability and enhance the realism of the ﬁre's movement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Explanation on how to operate a tool:</p>
                    <p>This code creates a visual and interactive program using particles and sparkles on a canvas. The program also includes buttons to control the volume of a sound.

                    When you run the code, you will see a window with a black background and various colorful particles and sparkles moving around. The particles are represented by small circles, and the sparkles are represented by even smaller circles.
                        
                    There are two buttons displayed on the screen: an upward arrow ("▲") and a downward arrow ("▼"). These buttons are used to control the volume of a sound.
                        
                    To increase the volume, click on the upward arrow button. Each click will increase the volume slightly. As you click, the button will animate by changing color to red and slightly increasing in size.
                        
                    To decrease the volume, click on the downward arrow button. Each click will decrease the volume slightly. Similar to the upward arrow button, the downward arrow button will animate by changing color to red and slightly increasing in size.
                        
                    The particles and sparkles will respond to the volume changes. When the volume is increased, the particles and sparkles will move faster, creating a more dynamic visual effect. When the volume is decreased, the particles and sparkles will slow down. You can experiment with clicking the buttons multiple times to adjust the volume and observe the changes in the particle and sparkle movement.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3: "Forest Scene"</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Brief outline of what it does:</p>
                    <p>This project is a simulation of falling leaves in a forest. It creates a visual representation of leaves falling from the trees and being inﬂuenced by wind. It uses the Processing framework to create a visual representation of leaves falling from trees and being inﬂuenced by wind. The code initializes a set number of leaves with random positions, sizes, and angles. The leaves are updated and displayed in the draw() function, with wind effects applied when the mouse is clicked. When a leaf reaches the ground, it stops falling. If a leaf goes off the screen, it is repositioned with new random values. Overall, the code creates a visually pleasing animation of falling leaves in a forest scene, with the leaves responding to mouse clicks and wind effects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Notes on the design decisions:</p>
                    <p>Notes on the design decisions:

                    As part of my project, I devoted the utmost attention to the aesthetic aspects, which led to a creative concept involving the independent creation of designs for leaves, trees, lakes, and birds. The new game, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, released last month, served as inspiration for me in creating these designs for my project. However, no aspect was left unattended, and special emphasis was placed on the color palette, which I personally selected to perfectly convey the autumn atmosphere. For me, autumn is associated with a variety of warm and vibrant hues.
                        
                    First and foremost, the colour orange, closely linked to maple leaves, is one of the key elements of my palette. The second important shade is red, encompassing dark red, burgundy, and raspberry nuances, typical of autumn leaves from trees such as maple, oak, and ash. Yellow, a bright and warm colour, also plays a crucial role in my palette, characterizing the autumn leaves of various tree species, including birch, aspen, and ginkgo. Brown tones, ranging from light brown to deep chocolate, are also widely prevalent among autumn leaves, particularly in oak and maple trees. Finally, the golden colour imparts warmth and a noble appearance to certain autumn leaves.
                        
                    As a result of my work on the project, my color palette has acquired high aesthetic value, embodying not only my inspirations from the game but also representing the diversity of hues characteristic of autumn.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Explanation for the user on how to run the project:</p>
                    <p> 1. When you run the simulation, a virtual forest scene appears on your screen. The scene is populated with several leaves, each represented by a unique image.
                        
                    2. As time passes, the leaves gently ﬂoat down, simulating their descent from the trees.
                        
                    3. The leaves are affected by gravity, giving them a natural and realistic motion.
                        
                    4. If you want to add some excitement to the scene, simply click your mouse. Your click generates a powerful gust of wind, causing the leaves to sway and change their trajectory.
                        
                    5. The strength of the wind can be adjusted to your preference.
                        
                    6. Watch as the leaves elegantly respond to the changing winds, creating a mesmerizing dance in the forest.</p>
